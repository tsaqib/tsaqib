### Hi, I'm Tanzim Saqib. 👋

I am an engineering futurist with mastery in Fintech, startups & chaotic engineering puzzles.

What I do daily: strategic innovation, large-scale architectures, category-defining products and people-first culture. Sensemaking of an incredibly high stake and complex business problem.

🔭 I’m currently building "Payments" for $3.6B at Clearco.
